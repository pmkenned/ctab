ctab README

The purpose of this library is to provide a simple interface for printing
neatly formatted tables in C.

Often times it is desirable to print a table of numbers and strings in such a
way that all the items of each column line up. For example,

Column A   Column B   Column C
Paul       5          Addison
Kris       127        Milbridge
Louis      -4         Harrington

Ensuring that these columns are lined up manually can be very tedious. It
requires finding the longest item for each column and then printing the
appropriate number of blanks after each item to ensure that the items in
the next column line up.

The printt function prints a table containing char *s. The programmer must
provide the table as a 1-D array of char *s along with the number of rows
and columns so that the array can be interpreted as a 2-D array.

If the programmer has the data they want to print in arrays corresponding
to the columns of the table, they can use the contab function to create this
array of char *s. The format string specifies the data type of each column.
The number of rows must be specified. The function also requires specification
of headers for the top of each column. Note: the number of rows does not
include the row for the headers.

The format string uses 's' for char *s and 'i' for ints.
